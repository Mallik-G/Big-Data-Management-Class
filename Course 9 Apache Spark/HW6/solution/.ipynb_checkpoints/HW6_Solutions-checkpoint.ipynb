Our college preparatory curriculum relies on our expertise in developing writers and building a tight-knit community. As we evolve and grow, Clinton remains committed to developing students who can think analytically and write creatively in a wide range of genres. Our arts programming builds on our 25 years of experience in visual and performing arts on a middle school level. We are also deepening our existing partnerships with City Center, Theater for a New Audience, Dancing Classrooms and the Associated Press, and taking advantage of our proximity to new cultural partners. Our academic core is based on the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. The IB Diploma is a good fit for our diverse community, and for the creative, confident, thoughtful and self-motivated learners that have always been successful at Clinton. Beyond the IB, we offer opportunities to take college courses at neighboring universities.',\n",
